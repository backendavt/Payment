# Enhanced PayHero Payment Service with Balance Updates

This enhanced version of the PayHero Payment service now automatically updates user balances in the database after successful payments.

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. **Automatic Balance Updates**
- ✅ Updates user balance in Supabase database after successful payment
- ✅ Uses phone number to identify users
- ✅ Atomic balance updates with proper error handling
- ✅ Transaction logging for audit trails

### 2. **Enhanced Payment Flow**
```
User Payment → PayHero API → Payment Success → Database Balance Update → UI Update
```

### 3. **Payment Amount Storage** ⭐ **NEW**
- ✅ Stores payment amount when payment is initiated
- ✅ Retrieves correct amount for balance updates
- ✅ Prevents balance update failures due to missing amount data
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of old payment records

## 🔧 **Recent Fix: Balance Update Issue**

### **Problem Identified**
The balance was not updating because PayHero's status response doesn't include the payment amount:
```
💰 Updating balance for phone: 0794314495, amount: 0, reference: FHC105317442.eI
💰 Balance update: 0 + 0 = 0
```

### **Solution Implemented**
1. **Store Payment Amount**: When payment is initiated, store amount with reference
2. **Retrieve Amount**: Use stored amount when updating balance
3. **Cleanup**: Remove stored data after successful balance update

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd Payment/nodejs-payhero-sample
npm install
```

### 2. **Environment Configuration**
Copy the template and configure your environment variables:

```bash
cp env.template .env
```

Edit `.env` with your actual values:
```env
# Supabase Configuration (REQUIRED for balance updates)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here

# PayHero Configuration
CHANNEL_ID=1692
PROVIDER=sasapay
NETWORK_CODE=63902
BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
PAYHERO_API_URL=https://backend.payhero.co.ke/api/v2

# Server Configuration
PORT=3002
```

### 3. **Database Requirements**
Ensure your Supabase database has a `users` table with:
- `id` (primary key)
- `phone` (unique phone number)
- `balance` (numeric balance field)

### 4. **Start the Service**
```bash
npm run dev  # Development mode
npm start    # Production mode
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. **Payment Processing**
- User submits payment through frontend
- Payment service sends request to PayHero API
- **NEW**: Stores payment amount with reference in memory
- Returns payment reference to frontend

### 2. **Status Checking & Balance Update**
- Frontend polls `/check-status` endpoint
- When payment is `SUCCESS`:
  - **NEW**: Retrieves stored payment amount
  - Fetches current user balance from database
  - Adds payment amount to current balance
  - Updates database with new balance
  - **NEW**: Cleans up stored payment data
  - Logs the transaction

### 3. **Error Handling**
- If balance update fails, payment status check still succeeds
- Errors are logged but don't break the payment flow
- Frontend can handle balance update failures gracefully

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Script**
Use the included test script to verify the fix:

node test-payment.js
```

### **Manual Testing**
1. Make a payment through the frontend
2. Check the payment service logs for storage confirmation
3. Monitor balance updates in the database
4. Verify the stored payment data is cleaned up

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Environment Variables**
   ```
   ❌ Missing Supabase environment variables
   ```
   - Ensure `.env` file exists with all required variables

2. **User Not Found**
   ```
   ❌ User not found with phone: 0712345678
   ```
   - Verify user exists in database with correct phone number

3. **Payment Amount Not Found**
   ```
   ⚠️ Payment amount not found for reference: X
   ```
   - Check if payment was properly stored
   - Use `/debug/payments` endpoint to see stored data

4. **Database Connection Error**
   ```
   ❌ Error updating balance: [error details]
   ```
   - Check Supabase URL and service key
   - Verify database permissions

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting:
```env
DEBUG=true
NODE_ENV=development
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Log Messages
- `💰 Stored payment details for reference: X, Amount: Y`
- `📊 Total stored payments: Z`
- `💰 Updating balance for phone: X, amount: Y, reference: Z`
- `💰 Balance update: old + new = total`
- `✅ Balance updated successfully: old → new`
- `🧹 Cleaned up old payment record: X`

### Database Queries
All balance updates are logged with:
- User identification (phone number)
- Amount added (now correctly retrieved)
- Reference number
- Timestamp (automatic)

## 🔄 Integration with Frontend

The frontend `PayHeroPayment` component now:
1. Passes phone number to status check endpoint
2. Receives confirmation of balance update
3. Shows success message with deposited amount
4. Automatically closes after 3 seconds

## 🚀 Next Steps

Consider implementing:
- **Redis Storage**: Replace in-memory storage with Redis for production
- **Transaction History Table**: Store all payment records permanently
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time payment notifications
- **Balance Validation**: Prevent duplicate balance updates
- **Admin Dashboard**: Monitor payment activities

## 🔍 **Verification Steps**

After implementing this fix:

1. **Check Payment Storage**: Look for `💰 Stored payment details` logs
2. **Verify Balance Updates**: Check `💰 Balance update: X + Y = Z` logs
3. **Confirm Cleanup**: See `🧹 Cleaned up old payment record` logs
4. **Test Database**: Verify balance is actually updated in Supabase
5. **Frontend Integration**: Ensure UI shows correct deposited amount

This fix ensures that **every successful payment now correctly updates the user's balance with the actual payment amount**! 🎯💰
